<b><i>Interests in IT</b></i>	
<br>
<br>
<i>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</i>
<br>
	<br>
An interest in IT initially began in 2019, after 2 visits in one week to some exhibitions that were on in Melbourne at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (ACCA) and Heide Museum of Modern Art. ‘Feedback Loops’ was conducted at ACCA in line with AsiaTopa, the description is below.
<br>
<br>
<i>‘Transforming ACCA's galleries, Feedback Loops invites you into the worlds of six Australian and international artists whose practices sample ideas and images from our past and present to speculate on the future
Encounter video, installation, interactive gaming and artificial intelligence as well as a program of live performance, populated by characters and conceptualisations that are at once real and fictive.’ (Asia Topa 2019)
	<br>
Heide showcased pioneering VR work from artists Jess Johnson and Simon Ward under the name Terminus. ‘Terminus presents a quest, a choose-your-own adventure into the technological’ (Heide 2019).</i>
	<br>I have no prior experience in IT. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i>
<br>
<br>
Last year I studied at RMIT finishing a degree in Fashion Design so I have an affinity with the university and how things work. This time with OUA, this RMIT course, in addition to Intro to Programming, were recommended to me as a precursor to the Murdoch via OUA degree in IT (games design and development).	
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i>
<br>
<br>
The expectation is to learn more about the world of IT and hope that it provides a jumping off point for further interest and research areas. In particular, to broaden knowledge around design applications within IT and the points at which design and IT intersect with human experience.

<br>
<br>
A junior to senior level software engineer is needed at the online gaming company - Wargaming, Sydney. The position is needed within the graphic and render team, with the ideal person having strong knowledge around low-level systems programming and high level rendering R&D for game development. This job is appealing given the freedom with creating game graphics and renders, allowing a combination of artistic skills and technical skills. <i>The skills are outlined below…</i>
API and GPU graphics pipelines
<br>
<br>
Affinity for modern rendering techniques
<br>
Experience with game engines and C/C++
<br>
Well versed in C++
<br>
Ability to problem-solve
<br>
Strong performance analysis and optimisation skills
<br>
Adaptable to currently utilised development processes and codebase
<br>
Aptitude for teamwork
<br>
<i>Current skills and experience relevant to the outlined role include…</i>
<br>
Excellent collaborator, great problem-solving skills, adaptable to change, reliable work ethic, high creativity and artistic skills, flexibility in work formats, attention to detail and strong visualisation skills. 
<br>
<br>
<i>A brief plan on how to achieve the outlined role…</i>
<br>
<br>
Work consistently towards obtaining a BA in IT (Games Design and Development). Immersion in the world of gaming, broad reading on programming and software applications in a gaming context. Master programs needed to successfully create rendering for game-like applications or other artistic applications. Develop strong design language within the context of game design. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Project Idea / Outline</b></i>	
<br>
<br>
An animation and VR sequence game that uses visual cues, objects and storyline to foster emotional reaction from the user. The game is contextualised for use within exhibition spaces that garner multiple transactory use from the public. The animation is structured to give a brief outline of the game landscape, the VR aspect encourages full immersion in the game landscape and a new temporary reality for the user. Set in a dystopian future world, the game promotes engagement between the user and the world, facilitating a choose your own adventure style interaction with the world and its inhabitants. 				
Familiar objects and obstacles from current real world realities are explored through a mutated dystopian lens. The user interacts with the world in a way that is designed to accomplish the following aims: generate obstacles for the user to overcome, create emotional engagement and links with the objects and characters in the game, generate empathy for the surrounding world. The overarching umbrella or broad context will be engagement with environment and inhabitants to foster wonder and empathy. Successful design in these areas is intended to lay the groundwork for generating these emotions towards the real world outside of the game. 
<br>
<br>
Currently there are drastic and complex climate issues that have irrevocably damaged our living environments. One component requiring change is the individual's inability to connect with the problems in a meaningful way that stimulates change on an individual and societal level. As individuals connect and emote from within the game setting, the hope is for them to carry this feeling into their living environments to promote change. 
Products would include a short animation sequence created in either unity or Cinema 4d and accompanying VR game made with Unity 3D or SketchUp. Further details about products are outlined below
<br>
<br>
Unity has the following features available to support and enhance VR content:
<br>
<i>High-Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) for VR and Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for VR ~ </i>
<br>
‘HDRP for VR targets high-end PCs and paves the way for stunning visuals without sacrificing performance. We’ve also created URP for VR, which is a single-pass forward rendering loop optimized for maximum performance on mobile hardware. No matter what head-mounted display (HMD) you’re targeting, we have a tool to help you achieve 
the highest level of graphical fidelity while continuing to optimize for performance.’ (Unity3d 2020)
<br>
<br>
<i>Spacial Audio ~</i>
<br>
‘Give users a sense of presence in VR with integrated support for ambisonic audio clips, the full-sphere surround sound technique. Rotate sound fields based on the listener’s orientation and head rotation.’ (Unity3d 2020)
<br>
<br>
<i>Particle System ~ </i>
<br>
‘Realize your vision and control VR performance. Use Particles for more effects and animations than ever, including lit lines and trails. Take advantage of better atlasing and batching of Particle Systems, align particles to their velocity direction and apply forces to the colliders they hit using the Collision module.’ (Unity3d 2020)
<br>
<br>
Cinema 4d and Unity are both easily accessible in terms of animation creation. Cinema 4d has a learning program that has software learning induction, and it becomes relatively straightforward for anyone with the motivation to create a quality animation. Unity similarly would be easy for any person willing to learn the software to create animation. VR on the other hand would require a high level of fluencency with the software and interlinked items required for game production. Including interaction and use of third party plug-ins such as Oculus and others like googleVR and open VR. (Unity3d 2020)
